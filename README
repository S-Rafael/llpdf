--------------------------------------------------------------------------
                         Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
llpdf is a Bash script for quick conversion of graphics images into PDFs.
Its main distinguishing features are:
- Support for multipage PDFs
- The ability to set page size and margins
- Aspect ratio preserving or stretchy scaling
- Guaranteed lossless compression of graphics images: no downsampling, no
  lossy JPEG-style compression, all pixels faithfully represented in PDF.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
                         Requirements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to run llpdf, you need a system with Bash version at least 4
and the following software:
- ImageMagick (provides the 'convert' command)
- Ghostscript (provides the 'gs' command).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
                         Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Simply drop the llpdf script in a directory included in your $PATH and 
grant execution rights.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
                         Usage
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Run the following command in your terminal:
llpdf --help
to obtain usage information. Here are some examples of what you can do:

llpdf -m=20mm scan.jpeg document.pdf
      Creates a single-page PDF file with the image in 'scan.jpeg' scaled
      proportionally to fit the default page size with 20mm margins

llpdf -sf -m=0 -p=B1 poster.png poster.pdf
      Creates a single-page PDF file in ISO/DIN B1 paper format. The image
      from the file 'poster.png' will be stretched to fill the entire page
      (margin is set to zero). If the file 'poster.pdf' exists, it will be
      overwritten.

llpdf -m=0.5in -p=Letter -va scanned-page*.tiff document.pdf
      Reads all files that arise from the shell expansion of the expression
      'scanned-page*.tiff' and make a PDF in Letter paper format with those
      images as pages, setting the margin width to 1/2 inch. The images are
      scaled in an aspect ratio preserving way. Script runs in verbose mode

./llpdf -m=20pt -ip=A5 --landscape *.jpeg pages.pdf
      Landscape mode A5 output with 20pt margins. All *.jpeg files in the
      current directory will be included as pages. The 'interpolate' flag
      will be set in the PDF file
